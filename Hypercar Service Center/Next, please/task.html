<h5 id="description">Description</h5>

<p>When a customer gets to the front of the queue, the operator needs to click the <code class="language-html">Process next</code> button so work can begin. This should happen when one of the mechanics has finished the previous job and is ready to serve the next customer. You can't define the exact time when this will occur in the application, so you should leave this task to the operator.</p>

<p>When the <code class="language-html">Process next</code> button is clicked, the application selects the next customer according to the priority defined by the algorithm:</p>

<ol>
	<li>If there are any customers in the oil change queue, they are served first.</li>
	<li>When the oil change queue is empty, customers in the tire inflation queue are next in line.</li>
	<li>Customers requiring diagnostics are served last.</li>
</ol>

<p>As soon as the operator presses the button, the selected ticket number should be displayed on screen for all customers to see, and the relevant queue's length should be reduced by one. The ticket doesn't need to be saved once this action has been completed — its number just needs to be shown on the screen.</p>

<h5 id="objectives">Objectives</h5>

<p>Your final task is to make a POST handler for processing the next ticket. After the request is received, the appropriate ticket should be removed from the queue. The handler should process POST requests at <em>&lt;base_url&gt;/processing</em>, where <em>&lt;base_url&gt;</em> is the host.</p>

<p>Don't forget there also needs to be a handler to show information about the ticket number of the customer who will be served now.</p>

<p>You need to create a  <code class="language-html">&lt;div&gt;</code> element with the content <em>Ticket #&lt;number_of_ticket&gt;</em>: </p>

<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;div&gt;Ticket #7&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>

<p>This should be on the page that will be displayed on screen to all customers.</p>

<p>If there are no tickets to process, the content of the element should be <code class="language-html">Waiting for the next client</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;div&gt;Waiting for the next client&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>

<p><div class="alert alert-primary">Note that the message 'Waiting for the next client' should be shown in two cases — when there are no tickets to process or when there are clients in the queue but the button 'Process next' hasn't been clicked yet. </div></p>

<p>The page with the ticket number displayed should be available at <em>&lt;base_url&gt;/next</em>, where <em>&lt;base_url&gt;</em> is the host. That means that once button 'Process next' is clicked, user should be redirected to &lt;base_url&gt;/next. You can use <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/topics/http/shortcuts/#redirect " rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Django redirect function</a> for that.</p>

<p><div class="alert alert-warning"> Be cautious: URLs in the <em>urls.py</em> module should not contain slashes at the end. </div></p>

<h5 id="examples">Examples</h5>

<p>Let's assume all the mechanics are busy, and the situation is as a follows: </p>

<ul>
	<li>Customers with tickets 5 and 8 are waiting in the oil change queue.</li>
	<li>The customer with ticket 4 is waiting for tire inflation.</li>
	<li>The customer with ticket 3 is waiting for diagnostics.</li>
</ul>

<p>When the mechanics finish the current job, and the operator pushes the <code class="language-html">Process next</code><em> </em>button, the customer screen should display the following information:</p>

<pre><code class="language-html">Ticket #5</code></pre>

<p>The ticket number 5 is displayed, so the customer with this ticket will be served now as customers requiring oil changes go first. The ticket after 5 will be 8, followed by 4, and the last ticket will be 3.</p>
